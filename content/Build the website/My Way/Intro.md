### In this way of building the website I wouldn't work online as the standard way 
### instead I will work off-line and I will teach you how to do It 


## Why I want to work offline?

### 1-It's a faster way 

### 2-it doesn't need any pipe-line as in GitLab which will give you the result late

### 3-you can easily see how the page look like at the same time 

## after we finish everything off-line we will upload the website online
