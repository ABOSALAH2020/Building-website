#### In order to design both schematic and PCB layout of the board I used EAGLE software. 
#### which can be downloaded from 
```https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/eagle``` 
#### if you have a AUTODESK student account.

#### After installation was complete I added a new schematic file. A schematic is a drawing representing connections between electronic components . 
#### Then I should add the components I need to use in my board, so I downloaded fab.lbr library
```http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabirbid/students/israa-rabbaa/ElectFiles/fab.lbr```.
#### Then from the Library bar, select Open library manager and browse the location of the downloaded library then it will be automatically added to the component list.
