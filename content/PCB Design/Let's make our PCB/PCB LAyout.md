#### We have designed the PCB on Autodesk Eagle which includes the essential components to
#### make this board working. The PCB includes an embedded microcontroller, a programming port
#### to upload your code on the microcontroller, 6 LEDs and their resistors and finally a FTDI port to
#### communicate with the PC later on. Install Autodesk Eagle and open the .sch and .brd files
#### attached to this guide and take a look into the designs
