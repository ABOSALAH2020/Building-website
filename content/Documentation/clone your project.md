#### In order to make edits on your website, you have to make a clone on your PC. To do so you will
#### need a software called sourcetree which is a gui tool for git. We will use sourcetree to make a
#### clone of your website, commit and push the changes to gitlab. Please follow the following steps
#### to setup sourcetree and configure it with your gitlab account.

### Install sourcetree


‚óè Install sourcetree (git gui for windows). https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

### Use sourcetree


Use sourcetree (Tools->launch ssh agent) to create ssh key
1. To generate an SSH Key, select Tools > Create or Import SSH Keys. This window should pop up:
[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh1.png)](/media/ssh1.png)

2. Click Generate, and move the mouse randomly until a key is generated:

3. A public key and a private key should appear. Save them both by clicking Save public key (save as .pub filetype),
and Save private key (save as .ppk filetype):

[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh3.png)](/media/ssh3.png)

4. This is how the .pub and the .ppk files should appear in your .ssh folder, along side with some other files:
[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh5.png)](/media/ssh5.png)
SourceTree might prompt you to load the private key. Simply load the .ppk file.

5. Add your public key in your remote server (eg. Bitbucket).

### Add the ssh key


To set up your SSH key, perform the following steps.


1Ô∏è‚É£ Open GitLab and go to your account settings.
[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh6.jpg)](/media/ssh6.jpg)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Click on SSH.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Click on Add SSH Key.
[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh7.jpg)](/media/ssh7.jpg)

4Ô∏è‚É£ To get information about your SSH key, enter the following command in your terminal. If you're using Windows, go to step 7:
```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
5Ô∏è‚É£ You should copy the entire content of the output in step 4, as shown in the following screenshot:
[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh8.jpg)](/media/ssh8.jpg)

6Ô∏è‚É£ If you're not using Windows, you can move to step 11.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Windows explorer and move to C:\Users\your_username\.ssh.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Right-click on id_rsa.pub and click on Open.

9Ô∏è‚É£ When asked for the program you want to use, select Notepad.

üîüSelect the entire content of the file that contains the SSH key.
[![Example file-tree menu](/media/ssh9.jpg)](/media/ssh9.jpg)


11 We now paste the content of the SSH key into the form in your GitLab instance. You can name the SSH key anything you want. It is recommended that you name it after the computer it came from. This way, it will be easier to know which key belongs to which machine. If you leave the name field empty, GitLab will generate a name for you.

12 Now, click on Add Key.

### Clone your project
